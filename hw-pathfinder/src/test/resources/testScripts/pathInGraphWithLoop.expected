# Find the shortest path in a graph with a loop

created graph g

added node A to g
added node B to g
added node C to g
added node D to g
added node E to g

added edge 1.000 from A to B in g
added edge 1.000 from B to C in g
added edge 1.000 from C to D in g
added edge 1.000 from D to A in g
added edge 5.000 from A to E in g

path from A to E:
A to E with weight 5.000
total cost: 5.000
